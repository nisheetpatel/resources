#### Tips for collaborative projects

> [!tip] Common settings
> Setup the same linter, IDE, and code auto-formatter. This way, there's no need to argue about silly things and the whole team can focus on what matters - the actual code. Refer to [[02 Programming#My coding setup\|my coding setup]] for details.

> [!info] Workflow
> Agree on a workflow if you can. I typically follow the [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). The article does a good job explaining the idea, but the tl;dr is to work on a separate branch for each new feature and not directly on master so you're not disturbing everyone else's work by pushing.
