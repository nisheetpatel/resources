##### Obsidian Publish alternatives

- [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)
	- By far the easiest one I found and the one I use to host my notes and this webpage. Can highly recommend :)
- [Perlite](https://secure77.de/perlite/)
	- Is not as straightforward to configure and use and is comparatively feature-poor
- [A comprehensive list of alternatives](https://flowershow.app/notes/obsidian-publishing-options#summary)

##### Obsidian Sync alternatives

I host my vault on Dropbox and use Dropsync for my phone. Slightly less convenient than using [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync), but it's free and works well for me especially since I don't use it with my phone much.
