# Knowledge management

#### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is nothing short of a magical tool for knowledge management. I have been using it extensively since its very early days and it is such an integral part of my workflow that I don't see myself functioning well without it. I have collected some of the resources that I found useful [[Obsidian resources\|here]].

#### Research management

##### Storage & reference management

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is free and open-source reference manager, incredibly useful, especially given its progressive filtering features, [super convenient browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) that allows adding arbitrary items (research articles, blog posts, youtube videos) to any collection, and cross-platform support.

##### Search

My go-to search places for any research articles are [Research Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWn3CgmoZlI) and Google (scholar). Neither one by itself is fully satifsying, but together, they work incredibly well. I have tried [elicit](https://elicit.org/) but didn't find it particularly useful.
