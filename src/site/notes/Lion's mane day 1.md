# Lion's mane day 1

I took 1 capsule of lion's mane at 11:30 am on 6th October 2021 (ask Julian for exact amount per capsule). It was weird! Not sure if there was a noticeable difference in focus, but I felt wonky for sure. I caught myself mumbling and humming random tunes and doing things that I wouldn't otherwise be doing.
