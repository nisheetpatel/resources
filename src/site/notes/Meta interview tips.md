Thanks to Adyasha Dash, Meta Zurich.

## Overview

Meta is like a startup, but they have strict HR policies when it comes to interviews. Even if the VP wants to hire you, you go through the same interview process.

#### Interview process

1. Basic coding interview 
2. Interview focused on coding/research
	- Might be research fundamentals. 
		- They focus on fundamentals because ppl BS a lot.
		- So they want to test whether you know your shit.
		- They might go into how some RL algorithm works or why I used a particular library in my research and I should be able to tell them. Ideally, something like I tested and benchmarked a few and decided to use it because of that.
3. System design interview
	- design fb feed or twitter feed
	- eg, google street view, for comp vision how to fuse the images, etc.
		- for me it will be more geared towards RL
	- Tip: always have the breadth and focus on your expertise. It's ok to not know something because how good are you at doing also depends on you being able to clearly communicate your thought process if you get stuck.
4. Behavioral
	- how I deal with situations
	- do I take ownership?
		- e.g. tell us about a failed project. They want to see whether I take ownership or just blame other things, e.g. shitty environment. Best to say clearly why something failed because it shows that I have reflected on it and taken things away from it.

#### What to do to prepare?

- leetcode:
	- 50 medium and 50 hard
- For Meta, do data structures and algorithms (fundamentals)
- google still asks about dynamic programming and such, but not Meta

## Extras

- She will send me a programming booklet from a Finnish guy. PDF available online.
