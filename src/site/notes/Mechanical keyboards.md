# Mechanical keyboards

## Good keyboards

- [Lil Shoosh: most satisfying sound](https://youtu.be/qvsNyOhYMkQ)
- [Hipyo Tech YT](https://youtu.be/q5A3sR-W9-E)

#### My keyboard

- I use [DasKeyboard 4 Ultimate](https://shop.daskeyboard.com/products/das-keyboard-4-ultimate?variant=594321629) with Cherry MX Blue switches. However, over time, I find it way too wide to use the mouse comfortably with it. Also, there are definitely better sounding keys :)

##### Tested alternatives

Berk's and Lindsey's Keychron and Ducky were amazing too
- They were both blues, but Ducky has Cherry and Keychron has Gateron
- I think I slightly preferred the Gateron switches. They have a more satisfying sound, but maybe a little less travel. Still feel great
