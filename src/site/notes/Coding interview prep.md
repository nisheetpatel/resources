## Coding interview prep

It seems like [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com) is the way to go to for prep. However, there are a million problems on there and it's very easy to get lost. A much better study plan is given in the [Tech interview handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) by the author of the famous [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list of questions on Leetcode that cover the most important concepts that programmers should know. The author of that list has since released an updated list called [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) that you could use for free and organize prep by scheduling time weekly.
