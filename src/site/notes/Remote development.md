For most remote development, [VSCode remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) should suffice. However, sometimes you just need full access to the screen and all. [Rust desk](https://rustdesk.com/) is a neat open-source solution that I often use to access my Linux machine from home. It's a little bit slower to connect, but it doesn't time you out nor disconnect you every 60 seconds unlike proprietary software such as TeamViewer.
