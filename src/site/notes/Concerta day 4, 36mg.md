# Concerta day 4, 36mg
I slept well the previous night. I went to bed around 23:00, was reading a bit but slept around 0:00 and woke up around 6:15.

## Reflections

## Time log
All the times below indicate the time at which the note was taken down. Hence, they mostly report what happened in the time period between the time of the header and that of the previous one, except of course, the first one, which reports the time at which I took the drug.

### 8:05
- Took 18 mg Concerta after breakfast at 6:30

### ~10:00
- Took another 18 mg Concerta
- Before I took this second pill, I was fairly motivated but highly distracted and all over the place
- I was jumping from one thing onto another, switching tasks like I normally do, but at least I was doing something

### 11:11
- I feel much more focused
- I was able to take a step back and prioritize.
	- I looked at my diary and completed a couple of things from there
	- I also reset my priorities for the day according to what I had actually planned the previous day

### 15:42
- I have been very focused
- Could easily attend, follow, and contribute to meetings 
- Managed to easily summarize and solve many problems
- Stuck to my list for the day and will finish it easily as far as I can see
