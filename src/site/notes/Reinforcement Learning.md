## Reinforcement Learning

If you have heard of RL, you have inevitably heard of the wonderful [Sutton Barto book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf), which is an excellent resource to get started with. However, if you're anything I am and get easily bored with books, there is a vast amount of incredibly useful resources that may help you absorb the material much quicker and in much more depth. Here are some that I have found useful:

#### Lecture series

- [David Silver's RL course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-)
- [Pieter Abbeel's Foundations of Deep RL](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjNymuBM9RdmB3Z9N5-0IlY0)
- [Sergey Levine's lecture series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfURIIhCrlt-wj9ByIVpbfGc)
- [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXoDfcPNqdnkdhRCrCCdVUOtKOwuBhJdF)
- [Martha & Adam White's RL specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning#courses)

#### Blogs & wikis

- [Lilian Weng's blog posts](https://lilianweng.github.io/archives/)
- [RL discord wiki](https://github.com/andyljones/reinforcement-learning-discord-wiki/wiki)
- [OpenAI Spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)
- [BAIR blog](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/about/)

##### Libraries

- [my benchmarking results](https://github.com/nisheetpatel/sb3-vs-rllib) with [SB3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) & [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html)
