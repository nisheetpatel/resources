# Concerta day 2, 18mg
I slept well the previous night. I went to bed around 22:45 and woke up around 6:00-7:00.

## Reflections
- Spatial awareness

## Time log
All the times below indicate the time at which the note was taken down. Hence, they mostly report what happened in the time period between the time of the header and that of the previous one, except of course, the first one, which reports the time at which I took the drug. 

### 8:57
- Took 18 mg Concerta after big breakfast

### 10:25
- I could start feeling the effects within about 30-45 minutes
- Reduced racing thoughts
- An interesting thing I noticed was that I didn't have to deep-breathe/meditate in order to be present. For an example, I was just moving around in the apartment but I could notice the sound of the truck go by on the main street.
- Heightened spatial awareness
- Ability to quickly do things that I had in mind and was supposed to do:
	- I immediately set up a plan for the next couple hours as soon as I got into the office
	- I called up the insurance guy with whom I had the appointment to reschedule
- I am able to use my diary/planner and also Obsidian (I did not forget its existence)

### 12:35
- I have been calm and able to focus better than usual
- Didn't need to listen to music, especially not hard techno. Melodic music was good enough
- Paying attention to my body's needs:
	- recognize the signals for thirst, hunger, bladder full much earlier and easier
	- I think this is perhaps because the mind is a bit clearer
- Interestingly, I now realize that I usually work in an extremely chaotic manner. But today (and even yesterday), I have not had that problem.
	- I was able to plan the full piece of code I want to implement, design the code, then follow and complete what I need. Definitely

### 18:03
- Very frustrating afternoon
- I was kinda motivated, but not so much. Very difficult to get work done. The code that I wrote earlier started breaking and doesn't actually produce all the plots needed, so that kinda sucks.
- I wasn't able to focus much in the meeting either.
- I really wanted a coffee but the sink was broken and I couldn't be bothered to make coffee
	- classic ADHD style if there's the tiniest bit of effort needed, I won't do it
