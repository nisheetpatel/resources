# Concerta day 3, 36mg
I slept well the previous night. I went to bed around 22:45 and woke up around 7:00.

## Reflections

## Time log
All the times below indicate the time at which the note was taken down. Hence, they mostly report what happened in the time period between the time of the header and that of the previous one, except of course, the first one, which reports the time at which I took the drug. 

### 7:55
- Took 36 mg Concerta w/o breakfast

### 8:51
- got into work around 8:17 
- Just having breakfast now (granola w vanilla yogurt)
- Definitely feel some positive effects; I can think clearly
- Even if I take my noise cancelling headphones off, I feel totally fine
- I feel highly motivated to do the work and am able to carefully parse out the details, make a meticulous plan, and I'm not jumping straight into the code without thinking first
- I really think I will get some good work done today
- However, I have a sharp deadline of things to do, so that could be a confound because I am always highly motivated whenever there is a deadline. What's unusual though is that I am not working impulsively, but rather carefully charting out a plan unlike my usual self
- Another difference I notice is that for this exact work when I was not on my meds (yesterday) and when the meds were wearing off in the evening on the day before yesterday, I was deeply despising it. I thought it was a complete waste of time. Instead, now I think it is actually highly productive and my collaborator's suggestions are very valuable.

### 9:47
- I have been listening to my techno set and it's great
	- However, I am not dancing to it as I usually do. It must be because I am able to suppress extraneous motor movements
- I was really good at charting out the plan for things to do
- However, when I got close to finishing up, I got quite distracted in the details of the formatting instead of continuing to do the actual work

### 12:20
- I was quite focused for most of the time
- I did not need music to keep me going
- Wasn't distracted much except perhaps a bit of work-related distractions (googling something that I need to implement in my code, etc.)
- I was able to look at the time prioritize what needed to be done, although not so much


### 16:47
- Afternoon was less productive but I was very motivated
- I didn't experience any distractions; or at least I don't think I did
- Didn't need music for the most of it. At least not to get work done.
